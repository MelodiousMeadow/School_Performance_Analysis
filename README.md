# School_Performance_Analysis

### This exploratory data analysis project using Python investigates the dataset of Portuguese students enrolled in both Portuguese language and math classes. It delves into the correlation between grades and various socio-demographic factors, including family size, home support, travel time to school, study routines, and alcohol consumption habits during the week.

#### Family Background:

Does the type of address (urban vs. rural) influence students' academic performance?
What is the relationship between family size and students' final grades?
Do students from families where parents live together tend to perform better academically?

#### Parental Education and Occupation:

How do the education levels of mothers and fathers individually impact students' final 
grades?
Is there any correlation between parents' occupations and students' academic performance?
Reasons for School Choice:
Do students who choose the school based on course preference perform better academically?
Does the proximity of the school to students' homes affect their final grades?

#### Support and Activities:

How does the availability of extra educational support (schoolsup) influence students' final grades?
Do students who engage in extracurricular activities tend to have higher final grades?
Health and Lifestyle:
Is there a correlation between students' health status and their academic performance?
How do alcohol consumption habits (both weekday and weekend) relate to students' final grades?

#### Internet Access and Technology:

Does internet access at home affect students' final grades?
Are students who express a desire for higher education more likely to have internet access at home?

#### Social Relationships:
Do students in romantic relationships perform differently academically compared to those who are not?
How does the quality of family relationships (famrel) correlate with students' final grades?

#### Time Management and Absences:

Is there a relationship between students' study time and their final grades?
Do students with higher rates of absences tend to have lower final grades?

#### Overall Performance and Correlations:

Are there any significant correlations between different attributes and students' final grades across both courses?
