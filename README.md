# School_Performance_Analysis

### This exploratory data analysis project using Python investigates the dataset of Portuguese students enrolled in both Portuguese language and math classes. It delves into the correlation between grades and various socio-demographic factors, including family size, home support, travel time to school, study routines, and alcohol consumption habits during the week.

#### Family Background:

Does the type of address (urban vs. rural) influence students' academic performance?
What is the relationship between family size and students' final grades?
Do students from families where parents live together tend to perform better academically?

#### Parental Education and Occupation:

How do the education levels of mothers and fathers individually impact students' final 
grades?
Is there any correlation between parents' occupations and students' academic performance?
Reasons for School Choice:
Do students who choose the school based on course preference perform better academically?
Does the proximity of the school to students' homes affect their final grades?

#### Support and Activities:

How does the availability of extra educational support (schoolsup) influence students' final grades?
Do students who engage in extracurricular activities tend to have higher final grades?
Health and Lifestyle:
Is there a correlation between students' health status and their academic performance?
How do alcohol consumption habits (both weekday and weekend) relate to students' final grades?

#### Internet Access and Technology:

Does internet access at home affect students' final grades?
Are students who express a desire for higher education more likely to have internet access at home?

#### Social Relationships:
Do students in romantic relationships perform differently academically compared to those who are not?
How does the quality of family relationships (famrel) correlate with students' final grades?

#### Time Management and Absences:

Is there a relationship between students' study time and their final grades?
Do students with higher rates of absences tend to have lower final grades?

#### Overall Performance and Correlations:

Are there any significant correlations between different attributes and students' final grades across both courses?


### Overall Conclusions

The exploratory analysis conducted reveals compelling insights into the factors influencing student academic performance across various dimensions. Urban residency emerges as predominant, with 68% of students living in urban areas compared to less than 20% in rural settings. Furthermore, students from smaller families demonstrate stronger performance in Math and Portuguese classes, suggesting a potential positive impact of familial environment on academic outcomes. The educational background of parents plays a significant role, particularly when parents are employed in teaching or healthcare, correlating with higher grades above a threshold of 12.5. Shorter commute times, specifically less than 15 minutes, are associated with better academic performance, with mean grades of 13 in Portuguese and 12 in Math, highlighting the importance of proximity to school. Interestingly, while school support and participation in extracurricular activities show no significant correlation with improved grades, weekday drinking negatively affects academic performance. Access to the internet, on the other hand, is positively associated with higher grades compared to students without connectivity. Relationship status shows no notable impact on grades, whereas positive familial relationships correlate with improved school performance. Increased study time positively influences grades, while higher numbers of absences predict lower academic achievement. The analysis also identifies strong positive correlations between grades across terms, indicating consistency in academic performance over time. Parental education levels exhibit a notable influence on student grades, whereas age shows weak correlations with final grades, suggesting age is not a significant predictor. Notably, no prominent negative relationships are found among the variables studied, emphasizing a lack of significant inverse correlations. These findings collectively underscore the complex interplay of familial, environmental, and personal factors shaping student academic success.

### Next Steps

The findings from this exploratory analysis offer actionable insights for schools aiming to improve student academic outcomes. Schools should tailor resources to support predominantly urban student bodies and consider initiatives that benefit students from smaller families, who show higher achievement in Math and Portuguese. Collaborations with parents in teaching and healthcare professions could enhance educational support. Prioritizing shorter commute times could reduce stress and optimize readiness for learning. Given the minimal impact of school support and extracurricular activities on grades, efforts should focus on addressing issues like weekday drinking through targeted interventions and ensuring equitable internet access. Promoting positive familial relationships, encouraging effective study habits, and implementing attendance strategies are crucial for maintaining consistent academic performance. Leveraging parental education levels as a predictor of success can guide tailored interventions, while recognizing age's minimal role underscores the importance of personalized educational approaches. These strategies collectively aim to create an environment conducive to maximizing student potential and achieving academic excellence.
