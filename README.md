# School_Performance_Analysis

#### This exploratory data analysis project uses Python to investigate the academic performance of Portuguese students in both Portuguese language and math classes. It explores correlations between grades and socio-demographic factors such as family size, parental education, commute time, study habits, and alcohol consumption habits.

### Travel Time to School

As observable below from the chart below, students with shorter travel times (<15 minutes) tend to show slightly higher mean final grades compared to those traveling longer distances.

### Parental Education and Occupation

Students whose parents work in healthcare or teaching tend to achieve higher grades (above 12.5 on a 20-point scale). Furthermore, students generally performed better in Portuguese than in math classes. The below visualization indicates that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and with less parental support might benefit from additional assistance and homework help at home.

### Influence of Alcohol on Grades

As seen in these graphs, moderate weekday drinking appears to have a more harmful effect on grades. The data also suggests that alcohol has a more adverse impact on specific subjects, particularly math. Other factors such as socioeconomic status, study habits, parental involvement, and mental health could also play a role in influencing final grades.

### Internet Access and Technology

According to the graph, students in Portuguese class who have internet access tend to achieve slightly higher grades compared to those without it. Moreover, grades in term 3 (G3) appear to be predominantly high. Therefore, there is a positive correlation between internet access and academic performance. Students lacking internet access may encounter challenges in accessing materials, especially outside of school.

### Overall Conclusions

The exploratory analysis reveals key insights into factors impacting student academic performance. Urban residency predominates, with 80% of students in urban areas versus 20% in rural areas. Students from smaller families perform better in Math and Portuguese, suggesting a positive familial influence on academic outcomes. Parental occupation in teaching or healthcare correlates with higher grades (>12.5). Shorter commute times (<15 minutes) are linked to better academic performance (mean grades: Portuguese 13, Math 12). Weekday drinking negatively affects grades, while internet access shows a positive association. Relationship status has no significant impact, but positive family relationships correlate with better academic performance. Increased study time boosts grades, whereas higher absences predict lower achievement. Consistent positive correlations across terms indicate stable academic performance over time. Parental education levels strongly influence grades, while age shows minimal correlation. Notably, no significant negative relationships are found among the variables, highlighting their interrelated complexity in shaping academic success.

### Next Steps

This initial analysis offers practical insights for schools to improve student outcomes. Schools should support urban students and implement initiatives benefiting smaller families, which excel in Math and Portuguese. Collaborations with parents in teaching and healthcare can boost educational support. Addressing commute times can reduce stress and optimize learning readiness. Given the limited impact of school support and extracurriculars, interventions should focus on issues like weekday drinking and ensuring equitable internet access. Strengthening familial relationships, promoting effective study habits, and managing attendance are vital for consistent academic performance. Tailoring interventions based on parental education levels and recognizing age's minimal role can further enhance educational strategies. These efforts aim to create an environment that maximizes student potential and achieves academic excellence.
