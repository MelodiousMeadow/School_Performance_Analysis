# Student_Performance_Analysis

#### This exploratory data analysis project uses Python to investigate the academic performance of Portuguese students in both Portuguese language and math classes. It explores correlations between grades (scale from 0 - 20) and socio-demographic factors such as family size, parental education, commute time, study habits, and alcohol consumption habits.

### Travel Time to School

Students with shorter travel times (<15 minutes) tend to show slightly higher mean final grades compared to those traveling longer distances.

### Parental Education and Occupation

- Students whose parents work in healthcare or teaching tend to achieve higher grades (above 12.5 on a 20-point scale).
- Students generally performed better in Portuguese than in math classes.

The below visualization indicates that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and with less parental support might benefit from additional assistance and homework help at home.

### Influence of Alcohol on Grades

Mooderate weekday drinking appears to have a more harmful effect on grades. The data also suggests that alcohol has a more adverse impact on specific subjects, particularly math. Other factors such as socioeconomic status, study habits, parental involvement, and mental health could also play a role in influencing final grades.

### Internet Access and Technology

Students in Portuguese class who have internet access tend to achieve slightly higher grades compared to those without it. Moreover, grades in term 3 (G3) appear to be predominantly high. Therefore, there is a positive correlation between internet access and academic performance. Students lacking internet access may encounter challenges in accessing materials, especially outside of school.

### Findings

The exploratory analysis into factors influencing student academic performance reveals several key findings:

- **Residency and Family Dynamics:** 80% of students reside in urban areas, and smaller family sizes correlate with better performance in Math and Portuguese, suggesting a positive familial influence.

- **Parental Influence:** Occupations in teaching or healthcare are associated with higher grades (>12.5) out of 20 point scale, indicating a significant impact of parental profession on academic success.

- **Commute Times:** Shorter commutes (<15 minutes) are linked to better grades (Portuguese: 13, Math: 12), highlighting the role of reduced travel stress in academic performance.

- **Lifestyle Factors:** Weekday drinking negatively affects grades, while internet access shows a positive association, possibly due to enhanced learning resources.

- **Social and Family Dynamics:** Relationship status has no significant impact, but positive family relationships correlate with better academic outcomes.

- **Study Habits and Attendance:** Increased study time boosts grades, while higher absences predict lower achievement, emphasizing the importance of consistent attendance.

- **Longitudinal Stability:** Academic performance shows stable patterns over terms, influenced by parental education levels more than student age.

The analysis underscores the complex interplay of residency, family background, parental occupation, commute times, lifestyle choices, and social dynamics in shaping student academic success. These insights emphasize the need for comprehensive support systems to optimize student outcomes.





### Next Steps

This initial analysis offers practical insights for schools to improve student outcomes. Schools should support urban students and implement initiatives benefiting smaller families, which excel in Math and Portuguese. Collaborations with parents in teaching and healthcare can boost educational support. Addressing commute times can reduce stress and optimize learning readiness. Given the limited impact of school support and extracurriculars, interventions should focus on issues like weekday drinking and ensuring equitable internet access. Strengthening familial relationships, promoting effective study habits, and managing attendance are vital for consistent academic performance. Tailoring interventions based on parental education levels and recognizing age's minimal role can further enhance educational strategies. These efforts aim to create an environment that maximizes student potential and achieves academic excellence.
